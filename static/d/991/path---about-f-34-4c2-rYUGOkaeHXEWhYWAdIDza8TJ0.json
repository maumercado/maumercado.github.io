Canada 🇨🇦!,</p>\n<p>I’ve been software engineer for almost 9+ years now, I started with Python and Python/Django,\nthen Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and lastly Javascript, specifically React and NodeJS.\nI love new challenges, and always striving to learn new things!\nLately I have being learning Go, Typescript, Terraform and CI/CD with GCP and\nCircleCI, also and always improving my functional programming chops.</p>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://sistemas.uniandes.edu.co/es/misis\">Master’s Degree in Computer Science</a>\nfrom <a href=\"http://uniandes.edu.co/\">La Universidad de los Andes</a></p>\n<p>You can see my professional experience in more detail <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauromercado\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>About hobbies and other interests, well, I used to be a kite boarding certified\nassistant back when I was living in Barranquilla 🇨🇴, I still kite board here in Vancouver,\nbut I mostly spend the weekends either biking, hiking, paddling boarding, or simply\nenjoying 🍻 with friends, during patio season! During the winter however is time to snowboard 🏂.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./Bratislava.JPG\" alt=\"This is me in Bratislava, amazing town.\"></p>\n<p>Everyone once in a while I like to take my camera off and take some pictures, and\nof course traveling, that’s a given tho’ it’s rare to find someone who does not\nlike to go traveling 🛫, of course, for pleasure!</p>\n<p>This blog is my attempt at giving back to the community by creating value\nthrough my learnings, and experiences, and by doing so I hopefully help someone, or at\nthe very least help my future self, by encountering solutions that I have written\nabout in the past. And lastly I found a lot of inspiration/courage by following\nand reading the writings of <a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/\">Kent C.
